## Topics Covered

This workshop on Github will introduce participants to source control and best practices with Git.  Learn how to collaborate on a team and keep track of changes through a shared code repository.  The basics of Github will covered, such as file structure, code versioning, and branching off a main source. We'll go over how to pull, modify, commit, and merge code onto a master branch.  Students will have the option of using a command-line interface or GitHub's user-friendly GUI desktop application.  This workshop is for those new to source control and versioning, or looking to improve their git skills.



## Pre-requisites: Before the workshop, please check and download the following:

If you're completely new to Git, we recommend using a combination of Git Bash(#1) with GitHub Desktop(#2)

### 1) Do you have Git installed?  

On Windows:
Open the "Command Prompt" application and type:
`git --version`

On Mac: 
Open the "Terminal" application and type:
`git --version`

If you don't see a version number, download Git here: https://git-scm.com/download and follow these instructions:

In general, free free to follow the default settings during the Git installation process, EXCEPT for the following:

* (1/2)Install Git components on your desktop for easy access to Git Bash, use default options.
